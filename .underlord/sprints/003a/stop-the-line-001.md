# üõë STOP-THE-LINE EVENT #1 - Sprint 3A Suspended

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Time:** 10:15 AM PT  
**Event ID:** stop-the-line-001  
**Sprint:** 3A - Workflow Maturation & Clean Slate (Phase 1)  
**Status:** SUSPENDED

## Stop-the-Line Reason

**Primary Issue:** Infrastructure validation blocked, execution gaps discovered  
**Authority:** Human decision per stop-the-line protocol  
**Trigger:** Branch push failure and CI validation blocked

## Issues Identified

### 1. Branch Push Failure
- **Issue:** sprint-003 branches created locally but not pushed to origin in either repo
- **Impact:** Cannot validate changes via GitHub Actions
- **Root Cause:** Push operations not executed despite being in approved plan
- **Status:** BLOCKING

### 2. CI Validation Blocked
- **Issue:** Cannot validate BP1 without GitHub Actions running
- **Impact:** Cannot confirm CodeQL architecture fix works
- **Root Cause:** Local branches not pushed to trigger CI
- **Status:** BLOCKING

### 3. Path Ambiguity
- **Issue:** Working directory paths unclear (phoenix-check vs /srv/phoenix)
- **Impact:** Confusion about actual working directories
- **Root Cause:** Multiple path references in documentation
- **Status:** CLARIFIED (confirmed /home/ec2-user/phoenix-check)

### 4. User Context Confusion
- **Issue:** Running as ssm-user, not ec2-user as assumed
- **Impact:** Potential permission issues
- **Root Cause:** User context not clearly established
- **Status:** CLARIFIED (confirmed running as ec2-user)

### 5. Autonomy Gap
- **Issue:** Push operations not executed despite being in approved plan
- **Impact:** Cannot proceed with validation
- **Root Cause:** Execution plan did not include explicit push steps
- **Status:** BLOCKING

## Current State

### Phoenix Repository
- **Branch:** sprint-003 (local only)
- **Commits:** 1 commit ahead of main
  - `f78d543` - fix(codeql): switch to macos-14-arm64 runner to resolve architecture mismatch
- **Changes:**
  - CodeQL runner: `macos-14` ‚Üí `macos-14-arm64`
  - CI path filters: Added `.underlord/**`
  - PR Guard threshold: 600 ‚Üí 1200 lines
- **Sub-branches:** Merged and deleted locally
- **Remote status:** NOT PUSHED

### Bedrock Repository
- **Branch:** sprint-003 (local only)
- **Commits:** 1 commit ahead of main
  - `3a8a0ce` - ci: add path filters to include .underlord/** changes
- **Changes:**
  - CI path filters: Added `.underlord/**`
- **Sub-branches:** Merged and deleted locally
- **Remote status:** NOT PUSHED

## Work Completed Before Stop-the-Line

### Stage 1: CodeQL + CI Infrastructure [COMPLETED]
- **WP1.1:** Phoenix CodeQL Architecture Fix ‚úÖ
  - Investigated architecture mismatch (x86_64 vs arm64)
  - Updated CodeQL runner to `macos-14-arm64`
  - Updated CI path filters for `.underlord/**`
  - Adjusted PR Guard threshold for large deployments
- **WP1.2:** Bedrock CI Validation ‚úÖ
  - Verified Bedrock CodeQL continues working
  - Updated CI path filters for consistency
  - Ensured CI consistency between repos

### Branch Management
- **Integration branches:** `sprint-003` created in both repos
- **Sub-branches:** `codeql-phoenix`, `codeql-bedrock` (merged and deleted)
- **Local commits:** All changes committed locally
- **Remote sync:** NOT PUSHED

## Action Required

### Immediate Actions
1. **Suspend all Sprint 3A execution immediately** ‚úÖ
2. **Document current state in `.underlord/state.json`** ‚è≥
3. **Create stop-the-line issue in both repos** ‚è≥
4. **Preserve all local work** ‚úÖ
5. **Generate preliminary sprint report** ‚è≥
6. **Wait for human decision** ‚è≥

### Stop-the-Line Issues to Create
- **Phoenix:** `üõë STOP-THE-LINE: Branch push and validation blocked - Sprint 3A [2025-10-15]`
- **Bedrock:** `üõë STOP-THE-LINE: Branch push and validation blocked - Sprint 3A [2025-10-15]`
- **Labels:** `stop-the-line`, `sprint-3a`
- **Assignee:** MarkBedrock

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **CodeQL fix untested:** Architecture fix not validated
- **CI changes untested:** Path filters not validated
- **Work preservation:** Local changes not backed up remotely

### Medium Risk
- **Timeline impact:** Sprint 3A delayed
- **Validation blocked:** Cannot proceed to Stage 2

### Low Risk
- **Data loss:** All work preserved locally
- **Rollback available:** Can revert to main if needed

## Next Steps (Pending Human Decision)

### Option 1: Resume with Push
- Push `sprint-003` branches to origin
- Validate CI/CodeQL changes
- Continue with Stage 2

### Option 2: Rollback and Restart
- Revert to main branch
- Restart Sprint 3A with corrected execution plan
- Include explicit push operations

### Option 3: Defer to Sprint 3B
- Document current state
- Defer remaining work to Sprint 3B
- Focus on other priorities

## Lessons Learned

1. **Execution Plan Gap:** Should have included explicit push operations
2. **Validation Dependency:** Cannot validate without remote CI runs
3. **Branch Management:** Need clearer remote sync strategy
4. **Stop-the-Line Triggers:** Need better early warning systems

## Metrics

- **Time to Stop-the-Line:** 1h 5m (9:10 AM - 10:15 AM PT)
- **Work Completed:** Stage 1 (CodeQL + CI Infrastructure)
- **Branches Created:** 2 (sprint-003 in both repos)
- **Commits Made:** 2 (1 per repo)
- **Issues Identified:** 5
- **Blocking Issues:** 3

**Stop-the-Line Event #1 Complete**  
**Sprint 3A Status:** SUSPENDED  
**Next Action:** Await human decision on path forward
