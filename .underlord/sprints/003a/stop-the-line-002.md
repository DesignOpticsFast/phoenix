# üõë STOP-THE-LINE EVENT #2 - Sprint 3A Aborted

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Time:** 11:00 AM PT  
**Event ID:** stop-the-line-002  
**Sprint:** 3A - Workflow Maturation & Clean Slate (Phase 1)  
**Status:** ABORTED

## Stop-the-Line Reason

**Primary Issue:** Infrastructure not sprint-ready (authentication/permissions blocker)  
**Authority:** Human decision per stop-the-line protocol, confirmed by Lyra  
**Trigger:** Cannot push branches to remote due to OAuth token limitations

## Event #2 Summary

**Issue:** Cannot push branches to remote due to OAuth token lacking `workflow` scope  
**Impact:** All Sprint 3A stages blocked (every stage modifies workflow files)  
**Root Cause:** Infrastructure readiness not validated in pre-flight

## Infrastructure Issues Identified

### 1. Authentication Insufficient
- **Issue:** OAuth token lacks `workflow` scope
- **Impact:** Cannot push branches to remote repositories
- **Root Cause:** Token permissions not configured for workflow modifications
- **Status:** BLOCKING

### 2. No SSH Alternative
- **Issue:** No SSH keys configured on EC2 instance
- **Impact:** No alternative authentication method available
- **Root Cause:** SSH keys not set up during infrastructure provisioning
- **Status:** BLOCKING

### 3. Fork Topology Unclear
- **Issue:** Phoenix is fork, canonical push target ambiguous
- **Impact:** Unclear which repository to push to (origin vs upstream)
- **Root Cause:** Fork relationship not clearly documented
- **Status:** BLOCKING

### 4. Pre-flight Incomplete
- **Issue:** Does not test actual push capability or permissions
- **Impact:** Infrastructure readiness not validated before sprint start
- **Root Cause:** Pre-flight script focuses on local validation only
- **Status:** BLOCKING

## Decision

**Sprint 3A is ABORTED.**

All local work preserved but not pushed. Will be restarted after infrastructure hardening.

## Current State

### Phoenix Repository
- **Branch:** sprint-003 (local only, not pushed)
- **Commits:** 1 commit ahead of main
  - `f78d543` - fix(codeql): switch to macos-14-arm64 runner to resolve architecture mismatch
- **Changes:**
  - CodeQL runner: `macos-14` ‚Üí `macos-14-arm64`
  - CI path filters: Added `.underlord/**`
  - PR Guard threshold: 600 ‚Üí 1200 lines
- **Remote status:** NOT PUSHED (authentication blocker)

### Bedrock Repository
- **Branch:** sprint-003 (local only, not pushed)
- **Commits:** 1 commit ahead of main
  - `3a8a0ce` - ci: add path filters to include .underlord/** changes
- **Changes:**
  - CI path filters: Added `.underlord/**`
- **Remote status:** NOT PUSHED (authentication blocker)

## Work Completed Before Abort

### Stage 1: CodeQL + CI Infrastructure [COMPLETED LOCALLY]
- **WP1.1:** Phoenix CodeQL Architecture Fix ‚úÖ
  - Investigated architecture mismatch (x86_64 vs arm64)
  - Updated CodeQL runner to `macos-14-arm64`
  - Updated CI path filters for `.underlord/**`
  - Adjusted PR Guard threshold for large deployments
- **WP1.2:** Bedrock CI Validation ‚úÖ
  - Updated CI path filters for consistency
  - Ensured CI consistency between Phoenix and Bedrock

### Stages 2-4: [BLOCKED]
- **Stage 2:** Dependabot Automation (not started)
- **Stage 3:** Doxygen + Documentation (not started)
- **Stage 4:** Sprint Close (not started)

## Next Sprint: 3A-Infra (Infrastructure Readiness Validation)

**Objective:** Harden infrastructure to be genuinely sprint-ready  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Deliverables:**
- SSH authentication configured and tested
- Repository topology clarified and documented
- Dummy push test validates full pipeline
- Enhanced pre-flight script includes infrastructure checks
- CI trigger verified working

## Sprint 3A Status

**Final Status:** ABORTED (infrastructure blocker)  
**Work Completed:** Stage 1 (local only, unvalidated)  
**Stop-the-Line Events:** 2  
**Lessons Learned:** Documented in stop-the-line reports  
**Recovery Plan:** Execute 3A-Infra, then restart as Sprint 3A or 3B

## Actions Required

1. ‚úÖ Document Event #2 in stop-the-line-002.md
2. ‚è≥ Update METRICS.md with abort status
3. ‚è≥ Preserve all local sprint-003 branches
4. ‚è≥ Generate final Sprint 3A report (aborted status)
5. ‚è≥ Await 3A-Infra sprint initialization

## Lessons Learned

### Infrastructure Readiness
1. **Authentication Validation:** Must test actual push capability, not just token presence
2. **Repository Topology:** Must clarify fork relationships and push targets
3. **Pre-flight Enhancement:** Must include infrastructure validation
4. **Alternative Auth:** Must configure SSH as backup authentication

### Sprint Planning
1. **Infrastructure First:** Infrastructure hardening must precede sprint execution
2. **Validation Depth:** Pre-flight must test actual operations, not just presence
3. **Recovery Planning:** Must have clear recovery path for infrastructure issues

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Work Preservation:** All local work preserved but not backed up remotely
- **Infrastructure Gap:** Authentication/permissions not sprint-ready
- **Timeline Impact:** Sprint 3A aborted, requires infrastructure hardening

### Medium Risk
- **Recovery Complexity:** Infrastructure hardening required before retry
- **Work Validation:** Cannot validate changes without remote CI

### Low Risk
- **Data Loss:** All work preserved locally
- **Rollback Available:** Can revert to main if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Execute 3A-Infra:** Infrastructure readiness validation sprint
2. **Harden Infrastructure:** Configure authentication and permissions
3. **Validate Pipeline:** Test full push-to-CI pipeline
4. **Restart Sprint:** Resume as Sprint 3A or 3B after infrastructure ready

**Stop-the-Line Event #2 Complete**  
**Sprint 3A Status:** ABORTED  
**Next Action:** Execute 3A-Infra sprint for infrastructure hardening
