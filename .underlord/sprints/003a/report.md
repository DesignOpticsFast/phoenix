# Sprint 3A Preliminary Report

**Sprint:** 3A - Workflow Maturation & Clean Slate (Phase 1)  
**Status:** ABORTED (Stop-the-Line Event #2)  
**Start Time:** 9:10 AM PT, October 15, 2025  
**Abort Time:** 11:00 AM PT, October 15, 2025  
**Duration:** 1h 50m  
**Completion:** 25% (Stage 1 complete locally, Stages 2-4 blocked)

## Executive Summary

Sprint 3A was aborted due to infrastructure authentication/permissions blockers discovered during Stage 1. While all planned Stage 1 work was completed successfully locally, the inability to push branches to remote repositories due to OAuth token limitations prevented validation of critical CodeQL architecture fixes and CI improvements. The sprint requires infrastructure hardening before retry.

## Work Completed

### ‚úÖ Stage 1: CodeQL + CI Infrastructure [COMPLETED]
**Duration:** 9:10 AM - 9:25 AM PT (15 minutes)

#### WP1.1: Phoenix CodeQL Architecture Fix ‚úÖ
- **Problem Identified:** x86_64 vs arm64 architecture mismatch
- **Solution Implemented:** Changed CodeQL runner from `macos-14` to `macos-14-arm64`
- **Additional Changes:**
  - Updated CI path filters to include `.underlord/**`
  - Increased PR Guard threshold from 600 to 1200 lines
- **Status:** Committed locally, not validated

#### WP1.2: Bedrock CI Validation ‚úÖ
- **Changes Made:** Updated CI path filters to include `.underlord/**`
- **Consistency:** Ensured CI consistency between Phoenix and Bedrock
- **Status:** Committed locally, not validated

### ‚ùå Stage 2: Dependabot Automation [BLOCKED]
**Status:** Not started due to stop-the-line event

### ‚ùå Stage 3: Doxygen + Documentation [BLOCKED]
**Status:** Not started due to stop-the-line event

### ‚ùå Stage 4: Sprint Close [BLOCKED]
**Status:** Not started due to stop-the-line event

## Issues Encountered

### üõë Stop-the-Line Events
**Event #1:** 10:15 AM PT - Infrastructure validation blocked, execution gaps discovered  
**Event #2:** 11:00 AM PT - Infrastructure not sprint-ready (authentication/permissions blocker)

#### Primary Issues
1. **Branch Push Failure:** sprint-003 branches not pushed to origin
2. **CI Validation Blocked:** Cannot validate changes without GitHub Actions
3. **Execution Gap:** Push operations not included in approved plan
4. **Path Ambiguity:** Working directory confusion (resolved)
5. **User Context:** User context confusion (resolved)

#### Impact
- **CodeQL Fix Untested:** Architecture fix not validated
- **CI Changes Untested:** Path filters not validated
- **Work Preservation:** All work preserved locally
- **Timeline Impact:** Sprint 3A delayed

## Technical Changes Made

### Phoenix Repository
- **CodeQL Runner:** `macos-14` ‚Üí `macos-14-arm64`
- **CI Path Filters:** Added `.underlord/**`
- **PR Guard Threshold:** 600 ‚Üí 1200 lines
- **Files Modified:**
  - `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/pr-guard.yml`

### Bedrock Repository
- **CI Path Filters:** Added `.underlord/**`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Branch Status

### Local Branches
- **Phoenix:** `sprint-003` (1 commit ahead of main)
- **Bedrock:** `sprint-003` (1 commit ahead of main)
- **Sub-branches:** Merged and deleted locally

### Remote Status
- **Phoenix:** sprint-003 branch NOT pushed to origin
- **Bedrock:** sprint-003 branch NOT pushed to origin
- **Validation:** Cannot validate changes without remote CI runs

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **CodeQL Fix Untested:** Critical architecture fix not validated
- **CI Changes Untested:** Path filter changes not validated
- **Work Preservation:** Local changes not backed up remotely

### Medium Risk
- **Timeline Impact:** Sprint 3A delayed, may affect Sprint 3B
- **Validation Blocked:** Cannot proceed to Stage 2

### Low Risk
- **Data Loss:** All work preserved locally
- **Rollback Available:** Can revert to main if needed

## Lessons Learned

1. **Execution Plan Gap:** Should have included explicit push operations
2. **Validation Dependency:** Cannot validate without remote CI runs
3. **Branch Management:** Need clearer remote sync strategy
4. **Stop-the-Line Triggers:** Need better early warning systems
5. **Autonomy Boundaries:** Need clearer definition of push permissions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Human Decision:** Choose path forward (resume, rollback, or defer)
2. **Push Branches:** If resuming, push sprint-003 branches to origin
3. **Validate Changes:** Run CI/CodeQL to validate fixes
4. **Update Plan:** Include explicit push operations in future plans

### Path Forward Options

#### Option 1: Resume with Push
- Push `sprint-003` branches to origin
- Validate CI/CodeQL changes
- Continue with Stage 2
- **Risk:** Medium (untested changes)
- **Timeline:** +30 minutes

#### Option 2: Rollback and Restart
- Revert to main branch
- Restart Sprint 3A with corrected execution plan
- Include explicit push operations
- **Risk:** Low (clean restart)
- **Timeline:** +2 hours

#### Option 3: Defer to Sprint 3B
- Document current state
- Defer remaining work to Sprint 3B
- Focus on other priorities
- **Risk:** Low (deferred work)
- **Timeline:** No additional time

## Metrics

- **Total Time:** 1h 50m
- **Work Completed:** 25% (Stage 1, local only)
- **Branches Created:** 2 (local only)
- **Commits Made:** 2 (local only)
- **Issues Identified:** 9 (5 in Event #1, 4 in Event #2)
- **Blocking Issues:** 7 (3 in Event #1, 4 in Event #2)
- **Stop-the-Line Events:** 2

## Next Steps

1. **Await Human Decision:** Choose path forward
2. **Create Stop-the-Line Issues:** Document in both repos
3. **Update State:** Document current state in `.underlord/state.json`
4. **Preserve Work:** Maintain all local changes
5. **Plan Update:** Revise execution plan based on lessons learned
