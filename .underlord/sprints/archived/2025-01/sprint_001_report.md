# Sprint 001 Report: Infrastructure Setup

**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Duration:** 5 days  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully established foundational infrastructure for Bedrock backend service including FastAPI framework, AWS Bedrock integration, testing framework, CI/CD pipeline, Docker containerization, and comprehensive documentation. All 8 planned phases completed with 78% test coverage achieved.

- ✅ **Testing Framework** - pytest setup with 78% coverage, mocking, fixtures
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions with test, lint, build, and deploy jobs
- ✅ **Docker Container** - Multi-stage build, optimized to 167MB
- ✅ **API Documentation** - OpenAPI docs with examples and architecture diagrams
- ✅ **Configuration Management** - Environment-based config with validation
- ✅ **Development Environment** - Reproducible setup with clear documentation

## Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: Boto3 Dependency Conflict
**Description:** Initial boto3 installation conflicted with botocore versions, causing import errors

**Resolution:** 
- Pinned boto3==1.34.10 and botocore==1.34.10
- Added dependency constraints to requirements.txt
- Documented version requirements

**Time Lost:** ~2 hours

### Challenge 2: Docker Build Performance
**Description:** Initial Docker builds took 8+ minutes, slowing development iteration

**Resolution:**
- Implemented multi-stage build
- Added Docker layer caching in GitHub Actions
- Optimized dependency installation order
- Reduced image size from 385MB to 167MB

**Time Lost:** ~3 hours (but saved 6 min per build going forward)

### Challenge 3: AWS Credentials in CI
**Description:** GitHub Actions needed secure way to authenticate with AWS

**Resolution:**
- Implemented OIDC authentication
- Created dedicated IAM role with least-privilege permissions
- Added secrets to repository settings
- Documented credential setup process

**Time Lost:** ~1.5 hours

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Multi-stage Docker builds** - Significant size reduction and faster builds
2. **pytest fixtures** - Made test writing much easier and more maintainable
3. **Early CI/CD setup** - Caught issues immediately, prevented technical debt
4. **FastAPI auto-docs** - Reduced documentation burden significantly
5. **Environment validation** - Caught configuration errors early

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Dependency management** - Should have used poetry or pipenv from start
2. **Earlier AWS testing** - Waited too long to test Bedrock integration
3. **Docker caching strategy** - Could have implemented earlier in sprint
4. **Test coverage targets** - Should have aimed for 85% from the beginning

### Surprises
- FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation is excellent
- AWS Bedrock retry logic needed more tuning than expected
- Docker build optimization had bigger impact than anticipated
- GitHub Actions OIDC setup was simpler than expected
