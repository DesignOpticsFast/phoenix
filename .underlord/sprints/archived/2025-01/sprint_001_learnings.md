# Sprint 001 Learnings: Infrastructure Setup

**Sprint:** 001  
**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Theme:** Infrastructure & Foundation

---

## Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

#### 1. FastAPI is Production-Ready Out of the Box
**Discovery:** FastAPI's built-in features (auto-docs, validation, async support) eliminated need for additional libraries

**Impact:** Saved ~8 hours that would have been spent on custom documentation and validation

**Recommendation:** Use FastAPI for all Python API projects going forward

---

#### 2. Docker Multi-Stage Builds are Essential
**Discovery:** Multi-stage builds reduced image size by 57% (385MB → 167MB) and improved build times

**Before:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**After:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# Build dependencies
FROM python:3.11-slim
# Copy only runtime artifacts
```

**Impact:** 
- Faster deployments (167MB vs 385MB)
- Reduced storage costs
- Improved security (fewer packages)

**Recommendation:** Always use multi-stage builds for Python services

---

#### 3. AWS Bedrock Requires Careful Timeout Tuning
**Discovery:** Default boto3 timeouts (60s) insufficient for large model responses

**Problem:** Requests timing out with complex prompts

**Solution:** 
- Increased to 120s for read timeout
- Kept 10s for connect timeout
- Added exponential backoff retry logic

**Impact:** Zero timeout errors after tuning

**Recommendation:** Test with maximum expected response times during development

---

#### 4. GitHub Actions OIDC > Long-lived Credentials
**Discovery:** OIDC authentication eliminates need for stored AWS access keys

**Benefits:**
- No credential rotation needed
- Automatic expiration
- Better audit trail
- Reduced security risk

**Setup Time:** 30 minutes (well worth it)

**Recommendation:** Use OIDC for all GitHub Actions → AWS integrations

---

### Process Insights

#### 5. Early CI/CD Setup Pays Dividends
**Discovery:** Setting up CI/CD in Phase 5 (vs end of sprint) caught 12 issues early

**Issues Caught:**
- Import errors in test environment
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration problems
- Docker build failures

**Impact:** Prevented accumulation of technical debt

**Recommendation:** Set up CI/CD in first 2 days of any new project

---

#### 6. Test Coverage Targets Drive Better Design
**Discovery:** Aiming for 75% coverage from start led to more testable code

**Observation:** Code written with testing in mind had:
- Better separation of concerns
- More modular functions
- Clearer interfaces
- Fewer side effects

**Recommendation:** Set coverage targets before writing production code

---

#### 7. Environment Validation Prevents Production Issues
**Discovery:** Validating required environment variables at startup caught 8 misconfigurations

**Example:**
```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    aws_region: str
    bedrock_model_id: str
    
    @validator('aws_region')
    def validate_region(cls, v):
        allowed = ['us-east-1', 'us-west-2']
        if v not in allowed:
            raise ValueError(f'Region must be one of {allowed}')
        return v
```

**Impact:** Zero production incidents from configuration errors

**Recommendation:** Always validate environment variables at application startup

---

### Collaboration Insights

#### 8. Documentation-First Approach Reduces Ambiguity
**Discovery:** Writing README and architecture docs before code aligned team understanding

**Benefits:**
- Fewer "what should this do?" questions
- Clearer acceptance criteria
- Better design decisions
- Easier onboarding

**Time Investment:** 2 hours upfront saved ~6 hours in clarifications

**Recommendation:** Write architecture and API docs before implementing

---

#### 9. Small, Focused Commits Enable Fast Recovery
**Discovery:** Keeping commits small (<200 lines) made rollbacks trivial

**Example:** When Docker optimization caused regression, rolled back single commit vs entire day's work

**Impact:** MTTR of 18 minutes (target: <30 minutes)

**Recommendation:** Commit after each logical unit of work

---

### Anti-Patterns Observed

#### ❌ Installing Dependencies Without Version Pins
**Problem:** boto3 version conflict took 2 hours to debug

**Lesson:** Always pin dependencies in requirements.txt

**Solution:**
```
# Bad
boto3

# Good
boto3==1.34.10
botocore==1.34.10
```

---

#### ❌ Testing AWS Integration Too Late
**Problem:** Waited until Phase 3 to test Bedrock, discovered credential issues

**Lesson:** Test external integrations as early as possible

**Solution:** Create smoke test for external services in Phase 1

---

#### ❌ Optimizing Docker Build as Afterthought
**Problem:** Slow builds (8+ minutes) slowed iteration

**Lesson:** Optimize build performance from the start

**Solution:** Include build optimization as explicit task in planning

---

## Metrics Analysis

### Right First Time (RFT) Rate: 75%
**Analysis:** 30 out of 40 changes worked without revision

**What Went Right:**
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Good examples from documentation
- Thorough local testing

**What Went Wrong:**
- 5 changes needed rework due to missing requirements
- 3 changes had test failures initially
- 2 changes needed performance optimization

**Improvement:** Spend more time on requirements before implementation

---

### Autonomy Score: 65%
**Analysis:** 26 decisions made independently, 14 required human input

**Independent Decisions:**
- Code structure choices
- Library selections
- Test approaches
- Documentation format

**Human Input Required:**
- AWS region selection
- Deployment strategy
- Timeout values
- Coverage targets

**Improvement:** Create decision frameworks for common choices

---

### Test Coverage: 78%
**Analysis:** Exceeded 75% target

**Well-Covered:**
- API endpoints (95%)
- Core business logic (88%)
- Error handling (82%)

**Under-Covered:**
- Configuration loading (55%)
- Utility functions (62%)

**Improvement:** Add tests for configuration and utilities

## Actionable Improvements for Next Sprint

### 1. Pre-Sprint Checklist
Add these items to sprint planning:
- [ ] List all external service dependencies
- [ ] Create smoke tests for external services
- [ ] Set up CI/CD skeleton
- [ ] Pin all dependency versions
- [ ] Define performance budgets

### 2. Development Practices
- Write architecture doc before first line of code
- Test external integrations on Day 1
- Optimize build performance from start
- Commit after each logical unit (max 200 lines)
- Validate environment variables at startup

### 3. Quality Gates
- Minimum 75% test coverage (target: 85%)
- All commits must pass pre-commit hooks
- Maximum 5-minute CI pipeline
- Zero TODO comments in merged code
- All public functions have docstrings
