CMake Error at /home/ec2-user/workspace/bedrock/CMakeLists.txt:51 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpenCASCADE.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "OpenCASCADE", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenCASCADE" with
  any of the following names:

    OpenCASCADEConfig.cmake
    opencascade-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenCASCADE" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenCASCADE_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OpenCASCADE" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
