# UnderLord Daily Checklist (Excerpt)

For the first "make daily" run each calendar day, UnderLord must:

1. Read `docs/UNDERLORD_MAC_ACCESS.md`.
2. Confirm in its output that it has reviewed the Mac Access Policy for the day.
3. Explicitly state that it will NOT access Mark's Mac without:
   - Presenting a plan, and
   - Receiving explicit "Yes" authorization from Mark for that specific task.
