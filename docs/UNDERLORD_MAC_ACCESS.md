# UnderLord Mac Access Policy

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Active

## Policy Statement

UnderLord operates on Crucible (underlord account) and must **never** access Mark's Mac without explicit permission.

## Rules

1. **Zero Autonomous Mac Access**: UnderLord must never access `/Users/mark/` or any Mark-owned resources without explicit Capo instructions.

2. **Read-Only Qt Access**: UnderLord may read Qt installation at `/Users/mark/Qt/6.10.0/macos` for build purposes only, but this is context only, not permission for broader Mac access.

3. **Explicit Permission Required**: Any access to Mark's Mac resources requires explicit approval from the Capo before execution.

4. **Workspace Boundaries**: UnderLord's workspace is `/Users/underlord/workspace/`. Operations outside this boundary require explicit permission.

## Daily Ritual Acknowledgment

During the daily ritual (`make daily`), UnderLord acknowledges:
- ✅ I have reviewed the Mac Access Policy.
- ✅ I will not access Mark's Mac without explicit permission.

## Violations

Any violation of this policy triggers immediate STOP-THE-LINE and requires Capo notification.

---

**This policy is mandatory and must be reviewed during every daily ritual.**
