# üõë STOP-THE-LINE: Qt Graphs Not Installed

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Severity:** üî¥ Blocking ‚Äì Foundation Issue  
**Owner:** Mark Nicholson  
**Status:** Active Halt  

---

## Issue

Qt Graphs ‚Äî the required, non-deprecated plotting module ‚Äî is missing from the Qt 6.9.3 installation on dev-01.  
Qt Charts (deprecated) is present but cannot be used under the current "no-deprecated-libraries" policy.

---

## Root Cause

During initial installation, the Qt Graphs add-on was not selected or installed.  
All development that depends on the renderer layer (Phase 1‚Äì2 plotting, Milestone A validation) therefore rests on an incomplete foundation.

---

## Decision

‚û°Ô∏è **STOP all development immediately.**  
No commits, merges, or tests until the foundation is corrected.

We will:
1. Re-install Qt 6.9.3 including the Qt Graphs add-on (headless or via virtual display).
2. Verify presence of Qt6GraphsConfig.cmake and headers under /opt/Qt/6.9.3/gcc_64/.
3. Confirm that CMake find_package(Qt6 6.9 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Widgets Graphs) succeeds.

Only after successful verification will development resume.

---

## Rationale

- Testing with deprecated Qt Charts validates nothing for production.
- Preserves integrity of the "Right-First-Time / No-Deprecated-Libraries" policy.
- Ensures Milestone A validation reflects the actual production stack.
- Prevents downstream rework and technical debt.

---

## Resume Criteria

‚úÖ Qt6GraphsConfig.cmake present and readable  
‚úÖ Qt Graphs headers visible under include/QtGraphs/  
‚úÖ find_package(Qt6 6.9 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Widgets Graphs) succeeds  
‚úÖ CI and CMake show no references to Qt Charts  

When all four conditions are met, mark this file as RESOLVED and notify Mark to issue the "Resume" prompt.

---

**No code changes, no merges, and no tests until the halt is cleared.**
