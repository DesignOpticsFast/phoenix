# üõë STOP-THE-LINE: Qt Graphs Not Installed

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Severity:** üî¥ Blocking ‚Äì Foundation Issue  
**Owner:** Mark Nicholson  
**Status:** Active Halt  

---

## Issue

Qt Graphs ‚Äî the required, non-deprecated plotting module ‚Äî is missing from the Qt 6.9.3 installation on dev-01.  
Qt Charts (deprecated) is present but cannot be used under the current "no-deprecated-libraries" policy.

---

## Root Cause

During initial installation, the Qt Graphs add-on was not selected or installed.  
All development that depends on the renderer layer (Phase 1‚Äì2 plotting, Milestone A validation) therefore rests on an incomplete foundation.

---

## Decision

‚û°Ô∏è **STOP all development immediately.**  
No commits, merges, or tests until the foundation is corrected.

We will:
1. Re-install Qt 6.9.3 including the Qt Graphs add-on (headless or via virtual display).
2. Verify presence of Qt6GraphsConfig.cmake and headers under /opt/Qt/6.9.3/gcc_64/.
3. Confirm that CMake find_package(Qt6 6.9 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Widgets Graphs) succeeds.

Only after successful verification will development resume.

---

## Rationale

- Testing with deprecated Qt Charts validates nothing for production.
- Preserves integrity of the "Right-First-Time / No-Deprecated-Libraries" policy.
- Ensures Milestone A validation reflects the actual production stack.
- Prevents downstream rework and technical debt.

---

## Resume Criteria

‚úÖ Qt6GraphsConfig.cmake present and readable  
‚úÖ Qt Graphs headers visible under include/QtGraphs/  
‚úÖ find_package(Qt6 6.9 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Widgets Graphs) succeeds  
‚úÖ CI and CMake show no references to Qt Charts  

When all four conditions are met, mark this file as RESOLVED and notify Mark to issue the "Resume" prompt.

---

**No code changes, no merges, and no tests until the halt is cleared.**

## Update: 2025-10-17 - Technical Blockers Identified

**Status:** ACTIVE HALT - Technical installation blockers identified

**Issues Encountered:**
1. **Qt Installer Framework Limitations:** The Qt installer (IFW 4.10.0) does not support:
   - `--list-packages` option (returns "Unknown option")
   - `--addRepository` option (returns "Unknown option")
   - `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` (offscreen platform plugin not available)

2. **Available Platform Plugins:** Only `minimal` and `xcb` are available, not `offscreen`

3. **Authentication Issues:** Previous attempts failed due to Qt Account authentication problems

**Technical Analysis:**
- Qt installer binary downloaded successfully (69.9MB ELF executable)
- Installer requires display and doesn't support headless command-line options needed
- Repository URLs are not accessible for direct package listing

**Next Steps Required:**
- Alternative Qt installation method needed
- System package manager investigation for Qt Graphs
- Manual Qt Graphs installation approach
- Or different Qt version/installation strategy

**Resume Criteria (unchanged):**
‚úÖ Qt6GraphsConfig.cmake present and readable  
‚úÖ Qt Graphs headers visible under include/QtGraphs/  
‚úÖ find_package(Qt6 6.9 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Widgets Graphs) succeeds  
‚úÖ CI and CMake show no references to Qt Charts  

**Work Status:** Halted for the day - technical blockers require alternative approach

## Update: 2025-10-18 - aqtinstall Attempt Failed

**Status:** ACTIVE HALT - aqtinstall approach also blocked

**Issues Encountered with aqtinstall:**
1. **Module Availability:** Qt Graphs module not available for Qt 6.9.3 via aqtinstall
2. **Authentication Required:** aqtinstall requires Qt Account credentials for official installer
3. **Package Resolution:** aqtinstall cannot find required packages (qt_base, qtgraphs)

**Technical Analysis:**
- aqtinstall v3.3.0 installed successfully
- Qt 6.9.3 is available in the repository
- No modules available for Qt 6.9.3 gcc_64 architecture
- Official installer requires Qt Account authentication

**Alternative Approaches Needed:**
- Manual Qt Graphs installation from source
- System package manager investigation
- Different Qt installation method
- Or proceed with Qt Charts temporarily (policy violation)

**Resume Criteria (unchanged):**
‚úÖ Qt6GraphsConfig.cmake present and readable  
‚úÖ Qt Graphs headers visible under include/QtGraphs/  
‚úÖ find_package(Qt6 6.9 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Widgets Graphs) succeeds  
‚úÖ CI and CMake show no references to Qt Charts  

**Work Status:** Halted for the day - multiple installation approaches blocked
