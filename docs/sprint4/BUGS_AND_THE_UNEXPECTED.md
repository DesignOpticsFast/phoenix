**Purpose**: Track actions that aren't working quite as expected, either because the implementation is not finished or because the specification was inadequate.

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-24

## üö® **Critical Issues**

### **CRIT-001: Help-About Icon Theming Issue**
- **Issue**: Help‚ÜíAbout icon not tinted correctly for non-System themes
- **Expected**: All icons should be properly themed including Help-About
- **Actual**: Help-About icon doesn't respond to theme changes

- **Impact**: Visual inconsistency in theming
- **Next Steps**: Fix icon theming for Help-About action

### **CRIT-002: Splash Screen Timing Issues**
- **Issue**: Splash screen timing and visibility not optimized
- **Expected**: Splash shows as early as possible, closes when MainWindow ready
- **Actual**: Startup time calculation may not reflect splash screen duration
- **Status**: üêõ **CONFIRMED BUG** - Reported by user
- **Impact**: User experience and startup time measurement
- **Next Steps**: Optimize splash screen timing and startup measurement

### **CRIT-003: Status Bar Startup Time Display**
- **Issue**: Startup time shows on left side and gets overwritten by 'Ready' text
- **Expected**: Startup time should be on right side and persist like other RHS items
- **Actual**: Startup time appears on left, gets overwritten
- **Status**: üêõ **CONFIRMED BUG** - Reported by user
- **Impact**: Status bar information display
- **Next Steps**: Move startup time to right side of status bar

### **CRIT-004: Ribbon System Not Fully Integrated**
- **Issue**: Dockable ribbons implemented but may not be fully functional
- **Expected**: Top (horizontal) & Right (vertical) dockable ribbons with FontAwesome icons
- **Actual**: Basic implementation with system icons, may have docking issues
- **Status**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Implementation added, needs testing
- **Impact**: Phase 1 completion blocked
- **Next Steps**: Test ribbon docking, floating, and icon integration

### **CRIT-005: FontAwesome Icons Not Integrated**
- **Issue**: Ribbon system uses system icons instead of FontAwesome
- **Expected**: FontAwesome icons with proper theming
- **Actual**: System theme icons (document-new, document-open, etc.)
- **Status**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Icon system exists but not connected
- **Impact**: Visual consistency and theming
- **Next Steps**: Connect IconProvider to ribbon actions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Priority Issues**

### **HIGH-001: Icon Selection Choices**
- **Issue**: User wants to make different choices for icons used
- **Expected**: Customizable icon selection for better visual consistency
- **Actual**: Current icon choices may not be optimal
- **Status**: üêõ **CONFIRMED BUG** - Reported by user
- **Impact**: Visual design and user experience
- **Next Steps**: Review and improve icon selection choices

### **HIGH-002: Debug Output Cleanup**
- **Issue**: Debug items still showing in Application Output
- **Expected**: Clean output unless debug info is helpful
- **Actual**: Debug output cluttering Application Output
- **Status**: üêõ **CONFIRMED BUG** - Reported by user
- **Impact**: Development experience and output clarity
- **Next Steps**: Clean up unnecessary debug output

### **HIGH-003: Telemetry System Incomplete**
- **Issue**: Basic telemetry hooks added but no comprehensive logging
- **Expected**: UI latency logging for <50ms chrome response validation
- **Actual**: Basic debug output only
- **Status**: üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Basic hooks added
- **Impact**: Cannot validate Phase 1 acceptance criteria
- **Next Steps**: Implement comprehensive telemetry logging

### **HIGH-004: Ribbon Floatability Not Tested**
- **Issue**: Ribbons implemented as dockable but floatability not verified
- **Expected**: Ribbons must be floatable, resizable, dockable to any side
- **Actual**: Basic QToolBar implementation
- **Status**: ‚ùì **UNKNOWN** - Needs testing
- **Impact**: Phase 1 acceptance criteria
- **Next Steps**: Test ribbon docking and floating behavior

## üîç **Medium Priority Issues**

### **MED-001: Menu Actions Not Connected to Ribbons**
- **Issue**: Some menu actions may not be properly connected to ribbon actions
- **Expected**: Consistent behavior between menu and ribbon actions
- **Actual**: Potential duplication or inconsistency
- **Status**: ‚ùì **UNKNOWN** - Needs verification
- **Impact**: User experience consistency
- **Next Steps**: Verify all actions work from both menu and ribbon

### **MED-002: Theme Integration with Ribbons**
- **Issue**: Ribbon actions may not respond to theme changes
- **Expected**: Ribbon icons update with theme changes
- **Actual**: Unknown if theme integration works
- **Status**: ‚ùì **UNKNOWN** - Needs testing
- **Impact**: Visual consistency
- **Next Steps**: Test theme switching with ribbons

## üêõ **Low Priority Issues**

### **LOW-001: Status Bar Performance Display**
- **Issue**: Status bar shows performance info but may be too verbose
- **Expected**: Clean status bar with essential info
- **Actual**: May show too much debug information
- **Status**: ‚ùì **UNKNOWN** - Needs review
- **Impact**: User experience
- **Next Steps**: Review status bar content

### **LOW-002: Tooltip Consistency**
- **Issue**: Tooltips may not be consistent between menu and ribbon actions
- **Expected**: Consistent tooltip text
- **Actual**: Potential duplication or inconsistency
- **Status**: ‚ùì **UNKNOWN** - Needs verification
- **Impact**: User experience
- **Next Steps**: Review and standardize tooltips
