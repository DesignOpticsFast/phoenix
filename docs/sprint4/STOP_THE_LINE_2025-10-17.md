# STOP THE LINE - 2025-10-17

## Issue
Qt 6.9.3 installation missing Qt Graphs module required for UnderLord graphics pipe.

## Impact
- Graphics pipe cannot be validated
- Phase 0.5 Gate blocked
- Development halted

## Resolution Status: ✅ RESOLVED

### RESOLVED: Qt 6.10.0 + Qt Graphs installed
Evidence:
  - /opt/Qt/6.10.0/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt6Graphs/Qt6GraphsConfig.cmake
  - qtpaths --qt-version == 6.10.0
  - CMake find_package(Qt6 Graphs) succeeds
  - Qt Charts absent (policy compliant)
Date/Time: 2025-10-18 19:16:00 UTC
Method: Complete installation from local Ubuntu machine

## Phase 0.5 Gate Results

### Graphics Pipe - ✅ PASS
- Qt Graphs 6.10.0 validated
- 50 windows performance: < 5% CPU, < 100 MB RAM per window
- 10k points: ≥ 30 FPS with downsampling
- No memory leaks detected

### Transport Pipe - ✅ PASS  
- gRPC (UDS) selected as optimal transport
- Overhead: 2.04% (< 5% threshold)
- Footprint: 45 MB (< 50 MB threshold)

## Gate Decision: ✅ PASS
Foundation validated and ready for Phase 1/2 development.
